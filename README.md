## Hello there!ðŸ‘‹

I'm Diego. I'm a software engineer hailing from the magical land of Colorado, USA. Outside of work, I am a hobbyist game developer that likes to participate in game jams. Thus, a large chunk of my repos are game jam entries. Feel free to try out the little games [here](https://diego-escalante.itch.io/) and learn from their source code. My pinned repos include some of the game jam entries I am most proud of.

Cheers!
